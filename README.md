# Ruth Meaning Map

A training tool for biblical text analysis, specifically for annotating the Book of Ruth with semantic, discourse, and pragmatic layers.

## Features

- **Clause annotation** - Multi-layer semantic analysis (8 layers)
- **Register filtering** - Show/hide sections by register type (narrative, dialogue, poetic, etc.)
- **Search** - Search by verse, Hebrew text, gloss, or translation
- **Progress tracking** - Save drafts and mark clauses complete
- **Export** - Download JSON exports of completed work
- **Participant tracking** - Manage mentions and participant relationships

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Static HTML + Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service)
- **Data Source**: Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHSA) via Text-Fabric

## Deployment

This app is deployed to GitHub Pages. On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions:
1. Injects Supabase credentials from repository secrets
2. Deploys the static files to GitHub Pages

## Development

The main application is in `app.html`, which is generated by a Python build script that processes BHSA data.

### Regenerating app.html

To regenerate the HTML file (requires Text-Fabric and BHSA data):

```bash
python build_full_book_editable_html.py
```
